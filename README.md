CRM, which stands for **Customer Relationship Management**, is a strategy, tool, or method used by businesses to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle.

Its main goal is to improve business relationships with customers, aid in customer retention, and drive sales growth. CRM systems can also provide customer-facing staff detailed information on customers' personal information, purchase history, buying preferences, and concerns.

Key components of CRM include:

1. **Sales Force Automation**: This tool helps sales teams manage leads, forecast and report sales, and streamline the sales process.

2. **Marketing Automation**: This feature aids businesses in automating repetitive and time-consuming marketing tasks such as email marketing, social media posting, etc.

3. **Contact Center**: This component provides a platform to manage customer interaction through multiple channels such as call, email, chat, etc.

4. **Service Automation**: This function supports the management of service requests, complaints, product returns, and information requests.

5. **Analytics**: CRM analytics help businesses make informed decisions by providing detailed insights into customer behavior and preference patterns.

6. **Workflows and Approvals**: CRM helps manage complex customer interaction processes by automating workflows and approval processes.

CRM systems are often integrated into other systems like email marketing software, web analytics, and e-commerce platforms. Examples of CRM platforms include Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, and Microsoft Dynamics 365.
